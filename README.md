# E-commerce Recommendation System  (Draft)

## Overview
Create a simple e-commerce recommendation system where users receive personalized product recommendations based on their browsing and purchasing history. 
The system will consist of four microservices: User Service, Product Service, Recommendation Service, and Notification Service.

## Microservices

### User Service
- Manages user-profiles and their activity.
- Stores user information, such as preferences and purchase history, in PostgreSQL.
- Exposes REST APIs for user registration, profile updates, and activity tracking.
- Produces Kafka messages when users interact with the platform.

### Product Service
- Manages product information.
- Stores product details, categories, and inventory in PostgreSQL.
- Exposes REST APIs for browsing products and retrieving product details.
- Consumes Kafka messages from the User Service to update product recommendations.

### Recommendation Service
- Generates personalized product recommendations for users.
- Processes user activity messages from Kafka and updates user profiles.
- Utilizes collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation algorithms.
- Sends recommendations to users through Kafka messages.

### Notification Service
- Sends notifications to users about new recommended products.
- Listens for recommendation events from the Recommendation Service via Kafka.
- Sends email or pushes notifications to users.

## Integration

### Kafka
- Use Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices.
- User Service and Product Service produce/consume messages related to user activity and product information.
- Recommendation Service produces messages for user recommendations.
- Notification Service consumes messages for sending notifications.

### PostgreSQL
- Each microservice uses its own PostgreSQL database for data storage.
- Establish a database connection from each microservice.

### Keycloak Integration
- Integrate Keycloak for security management.
- Use Keycloak to handle user authentication and authorization.

## Additional Features

### Machine Learning Integration
- Experiment with machine learning models to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Use tools like Apache Spark for batch processing user activity data.

### Caching
- Implement caching mechanisms to enhance the performance of recommendation queries.

### Dockerize Microservices
- Containerize each microservice using Docker.
- Use Docker Compose to manage the deployment of the entire system.

## Tech Stack
## Tech Stack

- **Java 21:** Use Java 21 for building each microservice.
- **Spring Boot 3.2.2:** Use Spring Boot 3.2.2 for building each microservice.
- **Apache Kafka:** For message-driven communication.
- **PostgreSQL:** As the relational database.

## Benefits
This project will provide hands-on experience with building microservices for a recommendation system, utilizing Kafka for event-driven communication, integrating with a database, incorporating machine learning for recommendations, and implementing security management with Keycloak. Additionally, it covers containerization using Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment.
